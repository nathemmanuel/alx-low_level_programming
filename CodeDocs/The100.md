# Code Docs
## Day 1
### What I've gotten
A general feel for how the code is supposed to run.
The `undefined reference to` error message happened because I didn't use the right function name.
### What have I not yet gotten
Still have to figure out the writing to file thing. The code doesn't work as I expect it to. It's not allowing me input any other information after my name.
