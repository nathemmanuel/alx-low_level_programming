#Functions, Nested loops
The tasks in this repo are based on functions and using nested loops. *Importantly, they should not use the standard library; only a function called "_putchar".*

##0-putchar.c
Write a program that prints _putchar_, followed by a new line.

The program should return 0

##1-alphabet.c
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar_ twice in your code

##2-print_alphabet_*10*
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
